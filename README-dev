Compiler Developer's Manual
===========================

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to develop this project you need the following list of
installed programs,

  Autoconf
  AutoGen
  Automake
  Bash
  GCC
  GIT
  Help2man
  Make

How to Set Up
-------------

The first step to working on Compiler is to run the bootstrap script
like this,

        $ ./bootstrap
	$ ./configure -C CFLAGS='-g'
	$ make

With this done, you can now start working on the project proper.

What To Do
----------

If you can't think of something to work on, there is a convenient
make-command set up to help you out,

        $ make todo-list

This will print out all the places where developers have left comments
indicating where work needs to be done.
