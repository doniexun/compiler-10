Compiler Developer's Manual
===========================

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to develop this project you need the following list of
installed programs,

  Autoconf
  AutoGen
  Automake
  Bash
  Bison
  Doxygen
  GCC
  GIT
  Help2man
  Lex
  Make

How to Set Up
-------------

The first step to working on Compiler is to run the bootstrap script
like this,

        $ ./bootstrap
	$ ./configure
	$ make

With this done, you can now start working on the project proper.

What To Do
----------

If you don't know how Compiler works, read through the documentation.
It has all been generated with Doxygen and thus should be easy to
generate read through.

If you can't think of something to work on, see the Doxygen generated
Todo List.

Alternatively, you can work on Compiler's general documentation in the
README and README-dev.
